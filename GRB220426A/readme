Width evolution graph has been plotted for this GRB.
We got 11 time stamps through bayesian analysis out which 10 were used to plot the graph.
There was some problem with the file of the 4th time stamp, it was giving errors while loading for spectral fitting and I could not get errors for the width corresponding to 9th time stamp (it kept going into that endless loop).
