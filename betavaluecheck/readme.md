This folder has the files that were used to check which of the two roots (not including the root near -2) gives us the correct beta value.
beta_check.dat has original values of alpha,beta and E_p of the selected GRBs.
width_re.dat has the corresponding width values.
beta_re.dat has values of the roots obtained by our program (check.f90).
